Important Notes to Self:
1. To spawn an entity, you have to have the world, then once you have world w, you can do w.spawnEntity(). Parameters include required location and type, and optional more.
2. Players belong to the following classes/interfaces: Entity, LivingEntity, Player.
2A. What you need is probably in the class LivingEntity, such as Eye Direction as a vector.
