Important Notes to Self:
1. To spawn an entity, you have to have the world, then once you have world w, you can do w.spawnEntity(). Parameters include required location and type, and optional more.
2. Players belong to the following classes/interfaces: Entity, LivingEntity, Player.
2A. What you need is probably in the class LivingEntity, such as Eye Direction as a vector.
3. Add the thing where the core regrows into an apple and then a gapple and then a god apple. If you eat the earlier stages it resets the cooldown.
