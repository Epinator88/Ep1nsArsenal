!1.20.4 TESTED. MAY NOT WORK ON LATEST VERSION!

Hello! This is the first plugin I've made, and the first plugin I've finished and published to GitHub. It adds a few items to Minecraft, that are specifically meant for combat purposes and cannot be crafted. Enjoy!

Here is everything added, in order of getting it:

Vampirism Sword: Steal hearts from those you attack and get them for yourself, only after the enemy dies. Or kill a nearby mob to get a fraction of the stored health in a pinch. Gives extra health as absorption.

Explosive Battleaxe: Explode the enemy with a swing of the axe. 5 second cooldown on explosion.

Repulsor Bow: Shot arrows are imbued with wind magic and are unaffected by gravity. Readying an arrow gives you slow falling for better aim. Arrows will launch enemies into the air given they are already airborne.

Gatling Bow: Click to shoot an arrow. No windup. Does slightly reduced damage compared to a normal bow.

Fake Pearl: A marble shaped like an ender pearl. When the marble lands, you are not teleported. Good for throwing off opponents.

Goated Apple: Enchanted Golden Apple that regrows. Takes 2m to refresh. Regrows in 40s phases which can be eaten but restart the growing process.

Longfall Boots: Pair of boots that fully negate fall damage. Uncrouching launches you into the air

Bulky Chestplate: A really thick chestplate that takes your fall damage and creates an explosion when you land based on that number. Works with Longfall Boots.

Nullifying Shield: Stops all custom hit effects from happening. If hit with the Vampirism Sword, the sword loses some stored health.

Ender Trident: Throwing the trident pulls the hit entity directly to you.

This is all the items. Then the features are:

Pot Punching: Hit thrown potions in the air to punch them in the direction you're looking in.

I'm very proud of all the work I've done on this. Bye!
