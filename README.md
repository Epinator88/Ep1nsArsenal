!1.20.4 TESTED. MAY NOT WORK ON LATEST VERSION!

Hello! This is the first plugin I've made, and the first plugin I've finished and published to GitHub. It adds a few items to Minecraft, that are specifically meant for combat purposes and cannot be crafted. Enjoy!

Here is everything added, in order of getting it:

Vampirism Sword: Steal hearts from those you attack and get them for yourself, only after the enemy dies. Or kill a nearby mob to get a fraction of the stored health in a pinch. Gives extra health as absorption.

Explosive Battleaxe: Explode the enemy with a swing of the axe. 5 second cooldown on explosion.

Repulsor Bow: Shot arrows are imbued with wind magic and are unaffected by gravity. Readying an arrow gives you slow falling for better aim. Arrows will launch enemies into the air. Use wisely.

Gatling Bow: Click to shoot an arrow. No windup. Does slightly reduced damage compared to a normal bow.

Fake Pearl: A marble shaped like an ender pearl. When the marble lands, you are not teleported. Good for throwing off opponents.

Goated Apple: Enchanted Golden Apple that regrows. Takes 2m to refresh. Regrows in 40s phases which can be eaten but restart the growing process.

Longfall Boots: Pair of boots that fully negate fall damage. Uncrouching launches you into the air

Bulky Chestplate: A really thick chestplate that takes your fall damage and creates an explosion when you land based on that number. Max blocks fallable without triggering an explosion is 10. Works with Longfall Boots.

Drill Helmet: Going upwards will break the blocks above you. Includes the Repulse from the Longfall Boots.

Blastproof Leggings: Take no damage from explosions at your legs. Your upper body and feet remain vulnerable, though.

Nullifying Shield: Stops all custom hit effects from happening. If hit with the Vampirism Sword, the sword loses some stored health.

Ender Trident: Throwing the trident pulls the hit entity directly to you.

This is all the items. Then the features are:

Pot Punching: Hit thrown potions in the air to punch them in the direction you're looking in.

I'm very proud of all the work I've done on this. Bye!



This is meant to be a tandem plugin in which my friend, MoonBoyGamer and I code weapons for minecraft!
