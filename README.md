!1.20.4 TESTED. MAY NOT WORK ON LATEST VERSION!

Hello! This is the first plugin I've made, and the first plugin I've finished and published to github. It adds a few items to Minecraft, that are specifically meant for combat purposes and cannot be crafted. Enjoy!

Here is everything added, in order of getting it:

Vampirism Sword: Steal hearts from those you attack and get them for yourself, only after the enemy dies. Or kill a nearby mob to get a fraction of the stored health in a pinch. 

Explosive Battleaxe: Explode the enemy with a swing of the axe. 5 second cooldown on explosion.

Repulsor Bow: Shot arrows are imbued with wind magic and are unaffected by gravity. Readying an arrow gives you slow falling for better aim. Arrows have a chance to launch enemies in the air (its a bug turned feature)

Gatling Bow: Click to shoot an arrow. No windup. Does the same damage as a normal arrow crit.

Fake Pearl: A marble shaped like an ender pearl. When the marble lands, you are not teleported. Good for throwing off opponents.

Goated Apple: Enchanted Golden Apple that regrows. Takes 1m30 to refresh.

Longfall Boots: Pair of boots that fully negate fall damage. Uncrouching launches you into the air

Nullifying Shield: Stops all custom hit effects from happening. If hit with the Vampirism Sword, the sword loses some stored health.

Ender Trident: Throwing the trident pulls the hit entity directly to you.

Pot Punching: Hit thrown potions in the air to punch them in the direction you're looking in.

And that's pretty much it for now! Ill add more later, but this seems like a lot already.
